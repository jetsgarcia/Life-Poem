A heart once bright, now dim with pain,
Dreams shattered by loveâ€™s cruel disdain.
In silent nights, your sorrow grows,
A river of tears that freely flows.

But know, dear soul, the nights are long,
The wounds run deep, the hurt is strong.
Love slips away like fading light,
And leaves you lost in endless night.

Yet somewhere in the distant haze,
A spark will rise through darkened days.
Another heart awaits your call,
And love will heal you after all.
